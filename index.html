                <p>At NutriSnap (the "App"), we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and store information when you use our app, which is a Trusted Web Activity (TWA) that saves data locally in your browser and uses Gemini for photo analysis.</p>

                    <h3>Local Data Storage</h3>
                    <p>The app saves data locally in your browser using browser storage technologies, such as localStorage or IndexedDB. This data includes user preferences, inputs, and app usage history, and is not sent to external servers.</p>
                    <h3>Photo Analysis Data</h3>
                    <p>If you use the photo analysis feature, Gemini processes the photos you upload to analyze their content. We do not store the photos you upload permanently, but Gemini may temporarily store them for processing purposes.</p>
